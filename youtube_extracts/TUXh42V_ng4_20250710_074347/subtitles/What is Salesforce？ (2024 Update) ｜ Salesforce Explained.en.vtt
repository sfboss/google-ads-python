Every company wants to improve
its relationships with customers.

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:06.573 position:63% line:0%
And AI, along with their trusted customer
data,

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.509 position:63% line:0%
has so much potential for doing just that.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.044 position:63% line:0%
But hey, I get it.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.113 position:63% line:0%
It can be really hard
if you don't know where to start

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.181 position:63% line:0%
or how to set up your company for success.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.451 position:63% line:0%
Luckily,
that's what Salesforce is all about.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:22.155 position:63% line:0%
Salesforce
pioneered the first ever cloud based CRM

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:25.158 position:63% line:0%
and today is the number one A.I.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.660 position:63% line:0%
CRM in the world.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.362 position:63% line:0%
Okay, well, wait a second.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.864 position:63% line:0%
Not sure what CRM is.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.799 position:63% line:0%
Well, you know, I got you here.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:36.236 position:63% line:0%
CRM stands for Customer Relationship
Management.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:40.006 position:63% line:0%
It's basically a system that manages
your customer data and gives every team

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.476 position:63% line:0%
in your company is the use tools that
help them take action.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:48.381 position:63% line:0%
We're talking tools
for sales, service, marketing, commerce

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:52.419 position:63% line:0%
and even industry specific ones
like financial services and health care.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:58.124 position:63% line:0%
Now, Einstein q is the full portfolio
of Salesforce products that brings CRM.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.627 position:63% line:0%
AI, data, and trust

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:04.631 position:63% line:0%
together on one integrated platform
with Einstein 1.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:08.101 position:63% line:0%
You can increase employee productivity
and improve customer relationships

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:12.772 position:63% line:0%
by personalizing every interaction,
which leads to better business results.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.541 position:63% line:0%
Now, let me give you some examples here.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:18.244 position:63% line:0%
For marketing, you can do something like
identify target audiences

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:22.115 position:63% line:0%
and build a customized journey
and launch a campaign for sales.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:25.652 position:63% line:0%
You can see every deal in detail
and prioritize leads

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.120 position:63% line:0%
that are most likely to buy.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.157 position:63% line:0%
And for customer service, you can provide
immediate support on any channel.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.394 position:63% line:0%
We like to say
these tools are better together,

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.197 position:63% line:0%
with everyone
working together on the same platform.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:40.934 position:63% line:0%
Your service teams can see every customer
interaction in sales, marketing

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:45.305 position:63% line:0%
and commerce, and sellers can see
if a customer has open support cases

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:49.676 position:63% line:0%
or if they've engaged with any marketing
activities like emails or your website.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:53.346 position:63% line:0%
Everyone gets a 360 degree
view of every customer,

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:56.850 position:63% line:0%
and that is what we call a Customer 360.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.220 position:63% line:0%
No matter what size, stage or industry
your business is in.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.756 position:63% line:0%
You can create your own customer
360 and unite all your departments

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:06.759 position:63% line:0%
around a single shared
view of your customers.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.163 position:63% line:0%
These days, companies
need CRM to be successful.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.366 position:63% line:0%
But with AI,
you can get even more value from it.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.072 position:63% line:0%
It's like a power up that helps you do
everything easier, faster and better.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.975 position:63% line:0%
But using AI won't really help
if your apps aren't integrated

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.245 position:63% line:0%
and your data is siloed,
or if you're relying on public

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.381 position:63% line:0%
AI models alone to help
you build a successful future.

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.952 position:63% line:0%
In AI, Salesforce addresses
all these problems head on and how?

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.221 position:63% line:0%
Well, first
you've got to get your data together.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:38.691 position:63% line:0%
Listen, AI only works
if it can access relevant data

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.894 position:63% line:0%
about your customers and your business.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:45.498 position:63% line:0%
So to enrich your CRM and take action
on your data faster, you need a data

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:49.402 position:63% line:0%
engine that connects your customer data
from a variety of sources.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.872 position:63% line:0%
Now, as a Salesforce user,
you'll enter data like accounts,

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.508 position:63% line:0%
contacts, leads and cases.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:58.444 position:63% line:0%
But the customer profile
you're adding these interactions too,

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:02.849 position:63% line:0%
can be so much more powerful
when it has data from other systems too,

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:05.919 position:63% line:0%
like how your customer
has been interacting with your website

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.320 position:63% line:0%
or using your products.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.422 position:63% line:0%
That's where Data Cloud comes in.

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:11.891 position:63% line:0%
Now, Data
Cloud connects data to Salesforce,

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.261 position:63% line:0%
so it's readily available in apps
that marketers, salespeople,

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:18.431 position:63% line:0%
customer service reps
and more use every day.

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:22.235 position:63% line:0%
And that goes for external systems
outside of Salesforce, too.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:25.138 position:63% line:0%
I mean, today
the average company uses over

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:29.409 position:63% line:0%
a thousand different apps
to track a single customer.

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:32.345 position:63% line:0%
It's impossible
to create connected experiences

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.747 position:63% line:0%
for your customers
and actually use your data.

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:37.517 position:63% line:0%
If all these systems don't
talk to each other.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:41.087 position:63% line:0%
But Salesforce has a library of connectors
that let you integrate even more

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:46.292 position:63% line:0%
apps and data into Salesforce no matter
where you have it stored or what format it’s in.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.728 position:63% line:0%
And if you want to see and understand
your data visually.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.497 position:63% line:0%
Salesforce has solutions
anyone can use to create

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:54.734 position:63% line:0%
charts, graphs
and other visualizations too.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:58.504 position:63% line:0%
Now, these data solutions are all designed
to help you bring your data together.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:02.008 position:63% line:0%
Use the apps
you want, and take action on data faster.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:07.547 position:63% line:0%
Now, after unifying your data,
you can harness the power of metadata.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:10.650 position:63% line:0%
Metadata
basically provides context for your data.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.921 position:63% line:0%
Now, without getting too much into it,
think of metadata as a common language

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:17.857 position:63% line:0%
for all the data across
all your Salesforce apps

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:19.626 position:63% line:0%
when they all speak the same language.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:23.596 position:63% line:0%
You can customize them quickly and easily
and get this.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:24.964 position:63% line:0%
Any metadata tools

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:29.602 position:63% line:0%
you use can be set up without code
and is instantly available in any app.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:33.673 position:63% line:0%
Metadata also helps and I understand
what kind of data it is,

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:37.143 position:63% line:0%
how it's used and how it's related
to other data in the system.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.647 position:63% line:0%
So it basically raises AI’s IQ.

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:42.015 position:63% line:0%
Yeah, good brain thinking.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.016 position:63% line:0%
Now, together,

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:47.720 position:63% line:0%
data and metadata enrich your CRM,
so you have more automation opportunities,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.225 position:63% line:0%
richer customizations, smarter AI,
and so much more.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:57.230 position:63% line:0%
And that brings us to how
you can scale easily and securely across

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.767 position:63% line:0%
your business to create better customer
experiences and improve business results.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.639 position:63% line:0%
Like I said before, using public
models alone that just won't cut it.

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:09.709 position:63% line:0%
They pool information from the internet,

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:12.712 position:63% line:0%
don't know your customers
and this is really important.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:17.583 position:63% line:0%
They can retain everything you ask them,
which can put your most sensitive data at risk.

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:20.353 position:63% line:0%
But Salesforce,
they created a trusted A.I.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:24.357 position:63% line:0%
called Einstein
that's specifically designed for CRM.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.194 position:63% line:0%
Fun fact we call our portfolio of products
Einstein 1

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:33.232 position:63% line:0%
because it's one platform with Einstein,
AI built into every app

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.803 position:63% line:0%
since Einstein AI works across
all your Salesforce apps.

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:41.174 position:63% line:0%
You don't have to deal with using ten
different apps with ten different models.

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:43.443 position:63% line:0%
That's why you're able to scale one AI

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:46.813 position:63% line:0%
across your entire company
quickly and securely.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.681 position:63% line:0%
Now, when it comes to security,

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:51.684 position:63% line:0%
you have the enterprise level
data privacy of Salesforce.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:55.088 position:63% line:0%
So when you ask Einstein something,
a number of security measures are taken

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:58.858 position:63% line:0%
to make sure your data is masked
or covered up

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:02.528 position:63% line:0%
and forgotten by the model
after the output is generated.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:05.331 position:63% line:0%
And since Einstein is grounded
in your customer data,

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:09.268 position:63% line:0%
it's outputs are specific
to your business to it can learn from that

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:13.106 position:63% line:0%
360 degree view of your customers
and understand what they need.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.109 position:63% line:0%
And that means your team
members can spend less time

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:19.112 position:63% line:0%
on mundane tasks and more time on customer
needs.

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:22.982 position:63% line:0%
For example, sales reps can ask Einstein
to write follow up

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:26.419 position:63% line:0%
emails for leads and summarize
phone calls and marketing teams.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:30.990 position:63% line:0%
They can ask Einstein to generate email
subject lines based on past performance.

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:35.728 position:63% line:0%
So Einstein knows how to help you
deliver success for all your customers,

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:37.263 position:63% line:0%
right in the flow of work.

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:41.801 position:63% line:0%
And when I say right in the flow of work,
I mean you have an actual

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:45.938 position:63% line:0%
conversational AI Copilot built 
directly into your apps.

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:49.876 position:63% line:0%
It's one persistent copilot
that works across every Salesforce

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:52.879 position:63% line:0%
app, which means it can see data
across every department.

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:55.948 position:63% line:0%
It's always ready to answer questions
and summarize convos

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.483 position:63% line:0%
with a click of a button.

00:06:57.483 --> 00:06:59.385 position:63% line:0%
Let's look at our sales example again.

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:01.587 position:63% line:0%
And if a sales rep asks Einstein

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:05.224 position:63% line:0%
to identify their top leads to follow up
with, Einstein can do that.

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:10.229 position:63% line:0%
But it can also see that one of those top
leads has an open customer service ticket

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:15.234 position:63% line:0%
and it can alert that rep to make sure
they help get it resolved a.s.a.p.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:21.174 position:63% line:0%
Now this A.I. copilot even works with Slack, a.k.a
the ultimate productivity booster.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.044 position:63% line:0%
You can search for answers in your Slack
channels, summarize information

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:30.450 position:63% line:0%
and update your CRM records
all without leaving the flow of work.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.485 position:63% line:0%
Right. Pretty amazing.

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:35.555 position:63% line:0%
Now, these are just a couple of examples
I say can also help you build

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:40.860 position:63% line:0%
automated workflows and backend processes
across Salesforce and any system.

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:44.430 position:63% line:0%
Now, you might be wondering
how all this is even possible.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:49.702 position:63% line:0%
Well, all the tools and apps
we talked about are built on the Einstein 1 platform

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:52.905 position:63% line:0%
Think about the Einstein
1 platform as the technical layer

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:56.042 position:63% line:0%
or the foundation of the whole Einstein
1 portfolio.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.312 position:63% line:0%
It's one customer platform
for your entire business

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:02.915 position:63% line:0%
that brings intelligence
automation, low-code

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:06.219 position:63% line:0%
app development, and more to every team
member in your company.

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:08.688 position:63% line:0%
No I.T. degree required.

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:11.257 position:63% line:0%
Now the Einstein
1 platform makes your data A.I.

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:14.494 position:63% line:0%
and customizations work
seamlessly across every app you use,

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:17.430 position:63% line:0%
and that means it can help you
move faster.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.366 position:63% line:0%
Take action on all your customer data
and pull ahead.

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.702 position:63% line:0%
In this A.I. revolution.

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:23.503 position:63% line:0%
All right.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:26.339 position:63% line:0%
So if you want to have a bright future
in A.I.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.509 position:63% line:0%
to make your business
more integrated than ever and to connect
