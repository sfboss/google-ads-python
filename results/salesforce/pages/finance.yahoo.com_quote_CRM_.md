  * ### Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 06/02/2025: Companies Raising Guidance 

This first-quarter earnings season has had a special tone. As usual, many
companies have offered guidance. But they also have increasingly focused on
the economy, tariffs, and overall uncertainty. On tariffs specifically,
managements are detailing any likely impact on profits and any plans to pass
price hikes on to customers and/or consumers. Our team of analysts is
factoring all this fresh data into sector outlooks, earnings forecasts, and
investment ratings. We track the list of companies raising guidance, and this
quarter that list often features companies in sectors such as Communication
Services, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Industrial,
and Information Technology. Often missing are companies the Financials,
Energy, and Materials sectors. Companies that are still able to raise guidance
despite the tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could feature managements
that have flexibility in a changing environment, and that is often a catalyst
for market-beating returns. Indeed, "Management Signals" is one of our
Investment Themes for 2025. The following is a list of some of the companies
in our Fundamental Universe of Coverage where management recently increased
guidance.

  * ### Stocks are lower at Friday midday. President Trump says that China is not 

Stocks are lower at Friday midday. President Trump says that China is not
adhering to trade agreements in place. A fresh economic report shows price
inflation slowing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures index printed at 2.1%
for April compared to 2.3% in March. Core PCE was 2.5% versus 2.6%. Still
sticky - housing and utility costs. Consumers are spending more on that
category, by nearly $50 billion year-over-year. We come back next week to
June. The Jobs report is out next Friday. Argus still expects that report to
show a healthy labor market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.43%.
Oil is at $61 per barrel.
