## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Salesforce&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section:
History")]

Salesforce was founded on March 8, 1999 by former
[Oracle](/wiki/Oracle_Corporation "Oracle Corporation") executive [Marc
Benioff](/wiki/Marc_Benioff "Marc Benioff"), together with Parker Harris, Dave
Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a [software-as-a-
service](/wiki/Software_as_a_service "Software as a service") (SaaS)
company.[6][7][8] The first prototype of Salesforce was launched in November
1999.[8]

Two of Salesforce's earliest investors were [Larry
Ellison](/wiki/Larry_Ellison "Larry Ellison"), the co-founder and first CEO of
[Oracle](/wiki/Oracle_Corporation "Oracle Corporation"), and [Halsey
Minor](/wiki/Halsey_Minor "Halsey Minor"), the founder of [CNET](/wiki/CNET
"CNET").[7]

Salesforce was severely affected by the [dot-com bubble](/wiki/Dot-com_bubble
"Dot-com bubble") bursting at the beginning of the new millennium, resulting
in the company laying off 20% of its workforce. Despite its losses, Salesforce
continued strong during the early 2000s. Salesforce also gained notability
during this period for its "the end of software" tagline and marketing
campaign, and even hired actors to hold up signs with its slogan outside a
[Siebel Systems](/wiki/Siebel_Systems "Siebel Systems") conference.[9]
Salesforce's revenue continued to increase from 2000 to 2003, with 2003's
revenue skyrocketing from $5.4 million in the fiscal year 2001 to over $100
million by December 2003.[10]

In 2003, Salesforce held its first annual **Dreamforce** conference in San
Francisco.[11] There were around 1300 attendees and 50 exhibitors at the
conference.[12]

In June 2004, the company had its [initial public
offering](/wiki/Initial_public_offering "Initial public offering") on the [New
York Stock Exchange](/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange "New York Stock Exchange")
under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110 million.[13][14] In 2006,
Salesforce launched Idea Exchange, a platform that allows customers to connect
with company product managers.[15]

In 2009, Salesforce passed $1 billion in annual revenue.[7] Also, in 2009, the
company launched Service Cloud, an application that helps companies manage
service conversations about their products and services.[16]

In 2014, the company released Trailhead, a free online learning platform.[17]
In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success
Platform.[18] In September 2016, Salesforce announced the launch of Einstein,
an artificial intelligence platform that supports several of Salesforce's
cloud services.[19][20] It reportedly acquired a 20-year license to be the
exclusive business-oriented software company allowed to use [Albert
Einstein](/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s likeness for $20
million.[21]

Salesforce launched the Sustainability Cloud (Net Zero Cloud as of 2022),
which is used by companies to track progress towards achieving their [net zero
emissions](/wiki/Net-zero_emissions "Net-zero emissions") goals.[22]

In 2020, Salesforce joined the [Dow Jones Industrial
Average](/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average "Dow Jones Industrial Average"),
replacing energy giant and [Standard Oil](/wiki/Standard_Oil "Standard
Oil")-descendant [ExxonMobil](/wiki/ExxonMobil "ExxonMobil").[23] Salesforce's
ascension to the Dow Jones was concurrent with that of [Amgen](/wiki/Amgen
"Amgen") and [Honeywell](/wiki/Honeywell "Honeywell").[5] Because the Dow
Jones factors its components by market price, Salesforce was the largest
technology component of the index at its accession.[24]

Across 2020 and 2021, Salesforce saw some notable leadership changes; in
February 2020, co-chief executive officer Keith Block stepped down from his
position in the company.[25] [Marc Benioff](/wiki/Marc_Benioff "Marc Benioff")
remained as chairman and chief executive officer.[26] In February 2021, Amy
Weaver, previously the chief legal officer, became CFO. Former CFO Mark
Hawkins announced that he would be retiring in October.[27][28] In November
2021, [Bret Taylor](/wiki/Bret_Taylor "Bret Taylor") was named vice chair and
co-CEO of the company.[29]

In December 2020, it was announced that Salesforce would acquire
[Slack](/wiki/Slack_Technologies "Slack Technologies") for $27.7 billion, its
largest acquisition to date.[30] The acquisition closed in July 2021.[31]
Journalists covering the acquisition emphasized the price Salesforce paid for
Slack, which was a 54% premium compared to Slack's market value.[32][_[better
source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_]

In April 2022, "Salesforce.com, Inc." changed its legal name to "Salesforce,
Inc."[33]

Acceleration Economy reported that Salesforce had surpassed SAP to become the
world's largest enterprise software vendor in August 2022.[3]

The next month, Salesforce announced a partnership with [Meta
Platforms](/wiki/Meta_Platforms "Meta Platforms"). The deal called for Meta's
consumer application [WhatsApp](/wiki/WhatsApp "WhatsApp") to integrate
Salesforce's Customer 360 platform to allow consumers to communicate with
companies directly.[34]

In November 2022, Salesforce announced it would terminate some employees from
its sales team.[35] That same month, Salesforce announced its co-CEO and vice
chair, Bret Taylor, would be stepping down from his roles at the end of
January 2023, with Benioff continuing to run the company and serve as board
chair. Within the week, former [Tableau](/wiki/Tableau_Software "Tableau
Software") CEO Mark Nelson and former [Slack](/wiki/Slack_\(software\) "Slack
\(software\)") CEO [Stewart Butterfield](/wiki/Stewart_Butterfield "Stewart
Butterfield") also announced their departures. When asked about the
departures, Benioff stated, "people come and people go"; Salesforce's stock
dropped to a 52-week low after Nelson's resignation.[36][37][38][39]

In January 2023, the company announced a [layoff](/wiki/Layoff "Layoff") of
about 10%, or approximately 8,000 positions. According to Benioff, the company
hired too aggressively during the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic
"COVID-19 pandemic") and the increase in working from home led to the layoff.
The company also reduced office space as part of the restructuring plan.[40]
The same month brought an announcement from [activist
investor](/wiki/Activist_investor "Activist investor") [Elliott
Management](/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management "Elliott Investment
Management") that it would acquire a "big stake" in the company.[41]

In January 2024, Salesforce announced it was laying off 700 employees (about
1%) of its global staff.[42]

In June 2025, Salesforce announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire
Informatica for $8 billion in a deal expected to close in early 2026.[43]

## Services

Einstein. It helps with making appointments, referrals, and gathering patient
information.[51]In July, Salesforce released an AI agent, the Einstein Service
Agent, with the ability to perform customer service actions, like enabling
product returns or refunds.[52]

In September 2024, the company deployed Agentforce (succeeding Salesforce
Einstein), an [agentic AI](/wiki/Agentic_AI "Agentic AI") platform where users
can create autonomous agents for customer service assistance, developing
marketing campaigns, and coaching salespersons.[53][54][55]

### Salesforce Platform

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Salesforce&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section:
Salesforce Platform")]

Salesforce Platform (formerly known as Force.com) is a [platform as a

allows developers to add applications to the main Salesforce.com
application.[56][_[failed verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability
"Wikipedia:Verifiability")_] These applications are hosted on Salesforce.com
infrastructure.[57]

Force.com applications are built using Apex, a proprietary
[Java](/wiki/Java_\(programming_language\) "Java \(programming
language\)")-like programming language[58] to generate [HTML](/wiki/HTML
"HTML") originally via the "Visualforce" framework. Beginning in 2015[59] the
"Lightning Components" framework has been supported. The Apex compiler was
designed by James Spagnola.[60]

As of 2014, the Force.com platform had 1.5 million registered developers
according to Salesforce.[61]

### Discontinued

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Salesforce&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section:

[help desk](/wiki/Help_desk "Help desk") and [customer
support](/wiki/Customer_support "Customer support") product acquired by
Salesforce for $50 million in 2011,[68][69]and consolidated with other
services into Service Cloud Essentials in March 2018.[70]

Do.com was a cloud-based [task management](/wiki/Task_management "Task
management") system for small groups and businesses, introduced in 2011, and

### Phishing attack

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Salesforce&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section:
Phishing attack")]

In November 2007, a [phishing](/wiki/Phishing "Phishing") attack compromised
contact information on a number of Salesforce customers. Some customers then
received phishing emails that appeared to be invoices from
Salesforce.[128][129] Salesforce stated that "a phisher tricked someone into
disclosing a password, but this intrusion did not stem from a security flaw in
[the salesforce.com] application or database."[128]

### ‘Meatpistol’ presenters fired at Def Con

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Salesforce&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section:
‘Meatpistol’ presenters fired at Def Con")]

In 2017, at [DEF CON](/wiki/DEF_CON "DEF CON"), two security engineers were
fired after giving a presentation on an internal project called
MEATPISTOL.[130] The presenters were sent a message 30 minutes prior to the
presentation telling them not to go on stage, but the message wasn't seen
until after they finished.[130][131] The MEATPISTOL tool was anticipated to be
released as open-source at the time of the presentation, but Salesforce did
not release the code to developers or the public during the conference.[130]
The terminated employees called on the company to open-source the software
after being dismissed.[132]

### RAICES donation refusal

The [not-for-profit](/wiki/Nonprofit_organization "Nonprofit organization")
organization [Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal
Services](/wiki/Refugee_and_Immigrant_Center_for_Education_and_Legal_Services

rejected a US$250,000 donation from Salesforce because the company has
contracts with [U.S. Customs and Border
Protection](/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection "U.S. Customs and Border
Protection").[133]

### 2018 taxes

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Salesforce&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section:
2018 taxes")]

In December 2019, the [Institute on Taxation and Economic
Policy](/wiki/Institute_on_Taxation_and_Economic_Policy "Institute on Taxation
and Economic Policy") found that Salesforce was one of 91 companies who "paid
an effective federal tax rate of 0% or less" in 2018, as a result of the [Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017](/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017 "Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act of 2017"). Their findings were published in a report based on the 379
[_Fortune_ 500](/wiki/Fortune_500 "Fortune 500") companies that declared a
profit in 2018.[134]

### Sex-trafficking lawsuit

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Salesforce&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section:
Sex-trafficking lawsuit")]

In March 2019, Salesforce faced a lawsuit by 50 anonymous women claiming to be
victims and survivors of [sex
trafficking](/wiki/Sex_trafficking_in_the_United_States "Sex trafficking in
the United States"), abuse, and rape, alleging the company profited from and
helped build technology that facilitated sex trafficking on the now-defunct
[Backpage](/wiki/Backpage "Backpage").com.[135] In March 2021, a judge granted
partial dismissal of the case, dismissing charges of negligence and
conspiracy, but allowed the case to proceed regarding charges of sex
trafficking.[136] In March 2024, the case was dismissed without
prejudice.[137] In September 2024, the [US Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit "United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit") denied a request to reverse
the dismissal.[138]

### Disability discrimination lawsuit in Japan

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Salesforce&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section:
Disability discrimination lawsuit in Japan")]

| This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to
reflect recent events or newly available information. _( March 2023)_  
---|---  
  
In July 2021, [Salesforce
Japan](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%BB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B9%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BB%E3%83%89%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%82%B3%E3%83%A0
"ja:セールスフォース・ドットコム") faced a discrimination lawsuit from a former employee,
according to Japanese legal media.[139] The firm declined to comment on the
suit to the media. The ex-employee, who has [Autism Spectrum
Disorder](/wiki/Autism_Spectrum_Disorder "Autism Spectrum Disorder") and
[ADHD](/wiki/ADHD "ADHD"), claimed she was discriminated against because of
her disability and terminated in the firm's Japan web marketing team. The suit
alleged that the anonymous woman, as an employee at Salesforce Japan from 2018
to 2020, faced [hate speech](/wiki/Hate_speech "Hate speech"),
[microaggressions](/wiki/Microaggressions "Microaggressions") and rejection of
[reasonable accommodation](/wiki/Reasonable_accommodation "Reasonable
accommodation") from the manager. She alleged that her attempts to resolve the
problem were met with pressure from HR and job coach. The lawsuit is still
continuing in Tokyo district court.[140][141]

In Japan, the legal disability quota for private companies is 2.3%. But
Salesforce Japan has not met the quota and pay levy from 2009 to 2021 except
2017. In 2020 the firm did not report the number of disabled employees to
Japanese labor official. Depending on the result of lawsuit, it is undeniable
that the firm may face a risk of negative impact to disability hiring such as
performance improvement plan on the disability employment act or disclosure as
social punishment from the labor official.[142]

_[Wall Street Journal](/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal "Wall Street Journal")_
reported that actor [Matthew McConaughey](/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey "Matthew
McConaughey") was paid 10 million dollars yearly for his role as a "creative
advisor and TV pitchman". American musician [will.i.am](/wiki/Will.i.am

understanding of technology".[143][144]

### Wrongful termination lawsuit
